There are multiple ways to access TensorFlow from R.

The benchmarking demo on this GitHub repository relies on R being able to find an existing Anaconda environment that already has TensorFlow installed.

These are the main steps for creating such a Conda environment. Note that these commands vary by operating system.


1. Create and activate new Anaconda environment:

conda create -n r-tensorflow pip python=3.6
source activate r-tensorflow


2. Populate new Conda environment. This gives a relatively complete Conda environment--some of these libraries are unnecessary at first, but may be useful later on.

conda install numpy
conda install scipy

conda install matplotlib
conda install seaborn
conda install h5py
conda install pyyaml
conda install requests
conda install Pillow
conda install cython
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu    #### CPU-ONLY VERSION: pip install --upgrade tensorflow
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
